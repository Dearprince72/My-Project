The Student Registration Web App is a lightweight and user-friendly application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage student data directly in the browser without the need for a backend or database. This application is ideal for small-scale projects, educational practice, or offline record-keeping systems.

🔍 Overview
Users can input basic student details including Name, Age, and Email, and save them into a table that is dynamically rendered on the same page. All records are stored locally using the browser’s localStorage, ensuring persistence even after the page is refreshed.

✨ Key Features
Add Records: Users can enter and submit student information which gets added to the records list.

Edit Records: Existing entries can be updated with new information using the edit function.

Delete with Confirmation: Deleting a record prompts confirmation using icons for a smoother user experience.

Duplicate Email Check: Prevents adding records with the same email to ensure uniqueness.

Persistent Storage: Utilizes localStorage to retain student data across sessions.

Responsive UI: Styled using CSS Flexbox for a modern and mobile-friendly layout.

🧰 Technologies Used
HTML5: For building the structure of the web page.

CSS3: For designing the layout and improving visual aesthetics.

JavaScript: For handling user interactions, form submission, and dynamic updates using the DOM.

Font Awesome: For edit and delete action icons.
